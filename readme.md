Just to let you know, I have completed several tasks recently. These include creating a fictional company overview and market study for a HEPA filter company, making a dashboard for a fictional coffee and tea company, and conducting a SWOT analysis for Apple Inc. Additionally, I have generated a primary Facebook Ad Click dataset with some analysis and basic data visualization in Tableau. For demonstration purposes, I have also included a layered map and an area chart using the Superstore dataset. I have created a dashboard of the Superstore set in PDF format for quick viewing. Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
